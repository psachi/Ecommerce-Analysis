# Ecommerce-Analysis
This project is a data analysis of an anonymized ECommerce data set to discover the current state of the business and discover trends. The project was initially done in Python (to clean the data and practice data analysis skills learned from Jose Portilla's Udemy course on data science) and Excel (for easier pivot table analysis and visualizations).
